# Futuracha: The Quirky and Eccentric Font
 
Futuracha is a display font that was created by a group of design explorers called hÃ¸ly. The name is a combination of words futura and cucaracha (cockroach in Spanish). The design is based on the basis of pf futura book, a geometric sans-serif typeface that was designed by Paul Renner in 1927. The letters' edges radically extend in a forceful way trying to remind the art deco's style. The serifs are based on Claude Garamond typefaces, a group of old-style serif fonts that were designed in the 16th century.

Futuracha was first published on Behance in 2012 and won an Evge award for its originality and creativity. It was downloaded by over 50,000 people in the first year of its publication. It was designed as a display font, so it's not recommended for extended texts. It's most suitable for headlines and logos. Futuracha includes both Greek and Latin characters as well as numbers and symbols.
 
One of the most interesting features of Futuracha is that it is an Open Type Font, which means that it can magically adjust and readjust as you write. Depending on the context, the font can change its shape and form to create a more dynamic and playful look. For example, the letter "o" can have different endings depending on the following letter. This makes Futuracha a very versatile and expressive font that can be used for various purposes.

Futuracha is a font that will surely catch your eye and make you smile with its quirkiness and eccentricity. It is a font that celebrates creativity and experimentation, and invites you to join the fun.

One of the inspirations behind Futuracha was the art deco movement, which was a popular style of design and architecture in the 1920s and 1930s. Art deco was characterized by geometric shapes, bold colors, and lavish ornamentation. It reflected the optimism and glamour of the era, as well as the influence of new technologies and cultures. Some of the famous examples of art deco are the Chrysler Building in New York, the Eiffel Tower in Paris, and the posters of Cassandre.
 
Another influence for Futuracha was the work of Paul Renner, a German typeface designer who created pf futura book. Renner was a pioneer of modern typography, who advocated for a functional and rational approach to design. He rejected the traditional and ornamental styles of his time, and instead embraced the principles of Bauhaus, a school of art and design that emphasized simplicity and geometric forms. Pf futura book was one of his most famous creations, which became a symbol of modernity and progress.
 
Futuracha combines these two influences in a unique and playful way. It takes the geometric shapes of pf futura book and adds serifs and extensions that resemble the art deco style. It also adds a touch of whimsy and humor by changing its shape depending on the context. Futuracha is a font that pays homage to the past, but also looks forward to the future.
