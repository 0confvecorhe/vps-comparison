One way to do this is by using the serial number of your rifle. Sako rifles have serial numbers that can help you identify the model, caliber and year of manufacture. However, finding and interpreting these serial numbers can be tricky, as they are not always consistent or easy to read. Here are some tips and resources to help you find out when your Sako rifle was made.
 
## Locate the Serial Number
 
The first step is to locate the serial number of your rifle. The serial number is usually stamped on the action of your rifle, near the bolt handle or on the left side of the receiver. Sometimes, it may also be engraved on the barrel or on a metal plate attached to the stock. The serial number may consist of numbers only, or a combination of letters and numbers.
 
## Identify the Model
 
The next step is to identify the model of your rifle. Sako has produced several models of rifles over the years, each with different features and specifications. The model name or number is usually stamped on the action of your rifle, along with the serial number. Some of the most common Sako models are:
 
- L46 / L469 / L461 Vixen: A small action rifle designed for .222 Remington and similar cartridges.
- L57 / L579 Forester: A medium action rifle designed for .308 Winchester and similar cartridges.
- L61R Finnbear: A long action rifle designed for .30-06 Springfield and similar cartridges.
- M78: A rimfire rifle designed for .22 LR, .22 WMR and .22 Hornet cartridges.
- P94S: A bolt-action repeater designed for .22 LR cartridge.
- AV / AII / AIII / AI / S491 / M591 / M995: Modern models of rifles with improved features and design.

## Use a Reference List
 
The final step is to use a reference list that matches serial numbers with production dates. There are several online sources that provide such lists, based on official records from Sako or other sources. However, these lists may not be complete or accurate, as some serial numbers may be missing or duplicated. Therefore, use these lists as a guide only, and not as definitive proof of your rifle's age. Some of the online sources that provide serial number reference lists are:

- Beretta: The official website of Beretta, which acquired Sako in 2000. It provides a list of serial numbers and dates for rifles imported by Beretta USA since 2000[^1^]. For older models, it also provides a link to another list based on data from Sako[^1^].
- The Hunter's Life: A forum for hunters and shooters that provides a list of serial numbers and dates for various Sako models, based on original hangtags or documentation from owners[^2^].
- 24 Hour Campfire: Another forum for hunters and shooters that provides a list of serial numbers and dates for various Sako models, based on data compiled in 1983[^3^].
- Sway Office: A website that provides a list of serial numbers and dates for various Sako models, based on unknown sources[^4^].

## Conclusion
 
Finding out when your Sako rifle was made can be an interesting and rewarding experience. By using the serial number of your rifle, you can identify the model, caliber and year of manufacture. However, keep in mind that serial numbers are not always reliable or consistent, and that online reference lists may not be complete or accurate. Therefore, use these sources as a guide only, and not as definitive proof of your rifle's age. If you have any doubts or questions about your Sako rifle's history, you can always contact Sako directly or consult an expert collector.
