*WARNING: A work in progress!*

* VPS Comparison

A comparison between some VPS providers that have data centers located in *Europe*.

Initially I'm comparing only entry plans, below *5$* monthly.

What I trying to show here it's basically a lot of things that I would want to know
before sign up with any of them. If I save you a few hours researching, like I
spend, I'll be glad!

Note:

- Scaleway has four grades of SLA, the first basic is for free if you want something better, you have to pay a monthly fee.
- One of the reasons why the Linode's documentation is so good and detailed is that they [[https://www.linode.com/docs/linode-writers-guide/][pay you 250$]] for write a guide for them if it's good enough to publish. They are a small team (about 70 people), so it makes sense.
- The Linode API is not a RESTful API yet, but they are working in an upcoming one.

Notes:

- The OVH panel has a very old interface, effective but antique and cumbersome.
- Linode also has a very old interface, too much powerful, but not friendly. But in the coming months they are going to deliver a new control panel in Beta.
- Linode let's you choose the Linux Kernel version in the profile of your instance.
- To reset the root password from the control panel is not a good security measure IMHO, it's useful, but you already have the KVM console for that.
- In Vultr you can copy/see the masked default root password, but not reset it. This is necessary because the password is never sent by email.
- You can resintall the instances using the same SO/App or choosing another one.
- Linode reinstall time (they call it rebuild) does not include the boot time, the instance is not started automatically.
- In Vultr can use a custom ISO or choose one from the library like SystemRescueCD or Trinity Rescue Kit to boot your instance and perform recovery tasks.
- Linode has an additional console (Lish) that allows you to control your instance even when is inaccessible by ssh and perform rescue or management tasks.
- In Scaleway you have to set a root password first to get access to the KVM console.
- The Scaleway's control panel in the basic account/SLA level is very limited and counter-intuitive, I don't know if this improves with superior levels.

 Notes:
- Some providers offer more one-click Apps that I do not include here to save space.
- Some of this apps in some providers require a bigger and more expensive plan that the entry ones below 5$ that I analyze here.
- Linode does not offers you any one-click app. Linode is old-school, you can do it yourself, and also Linode gives you plenty of detailed documentation do it that way.
- OVH uses Ubuntu, Debian or CentOS as SO for its apps.
- Digital Ocean uses Ubuntu as SO for all of its apps.
- Vultr uses CentOS as SO for all of its apps.
- OVH Also offers Dokku on Ubuntu.
- Do you really need a Panel (like cPanel)? They usually are a considerable security risk with several vulnerabilities.

 Notes:

- Linode lets you install virtually any SO in your instance in the old-school way, almost as if you'd have to deal with the bare metal. Even the instance does not boot itself at the end, you have to boot it yourself from the control panel.
- The Vultr's ISO image library include several ISOs like Alpine, Arch, Finnix, FreePBX, pfSense, Rancher Os, SystemRescueCD, and Trinity Rescue Kit.
- The Vultr's "Custom ISO image" feature allows you to install virtually any SO supported by KVM and the server architecture.
- Linode does not preload your ssh keys into the instance automatically, but it's trivial to do it manually anyway (ssh-copy-id).
- To test the "Distro install in instance" I use a installation script to install Arch Linux from an official Debian instance. The purpose is to test if you are restricted in any way to use a different SO than the ones officially supported.
- The "Distro install" script fails partially in OVH and Linode, requires your manual intervention, that does not mean that you are not able to do it, only that you'll probably need more work to do it.
- Scaleway has a curious way to provide custom images, a service called [[https://github.com/scaleway/image-builder][Image Builder.]] You have to create an instance with the Image Builder an from there you are able to create you own ISO image usign a Docker builder system that create images that can run on real hardware.

Notes:

- Send plain text passwords by email is a very bad practice in terms of security.
- OVH sends you the root password optionally if you use SSH keys, always in plain text if not.
- Linode never sends you the root password because you are the one that sets it (even boot the instance for first time).
- DigitalOcean sends you the passwords only if you don't use SSH keys, in plain text.
- Vultr never sends you the root password, only the needed ones for one-click apps.
- Linode only register the last login time for each user, and does not register the IP.
- The account password recovery should be always through a reset link by email, and never get you current password back (and in plain text), but you never know... and if you find a provider doing that, you don't need to know anymore, get out of there as soon as possible and never reuse that password (any password).

 Note:

- The prices for DigitalOcean and Vultr not include taxes (VAT) for European countries.
- I have serious doubts about the OVH's and Scaleway's unlimited traffic, seems more marketing than real to me (joe di castro).
- Linode allows you to have free additional public IPs but you have to request them to support and justify that you need them.
- Linode Longview's monitoring system is free up to 10 clients, but also has a professional version that starts at 20$/mo for three client.
- Linode don't support currently block storage, but they are working on it to offer the service in the upcoming months.
- Linode snapshots (called Images) are limited to 2GB per Image, with a total of 10GB total Image storage and 3 Images per account. Disks of recently rebuilt instances are automatically stored as Images.
- Scaleway also offers for the same price a BareMetal plan (with 4 ARM Cores), but as it is a dedicated server, I do not include it here.
- Scaleway does not offers Anti-DDoS protection but they maintain that they use the Online.net's standard one.
- Scaleway uses dynamic IPs by default as private IPs and you only can opt to use static IPs if you *remove* the Public IP from the instance.

 Notes:

- Clearly the OVH's disk performance is limited by software, there is no other way to get so round results. Seems that older instances or other plans are not affected by this problem.
- The small bandwidth available in this OVH plan clearly affects the network performance.

 *Warning*: Performance tests can be affected by locations, data centers and VPS host neighbors.

 *Warning*: These numbers are provisional ones, I'm automating this process, so I going to repeat all of this tests for the already tested and extend them to the other VPS providers. I also have the intention of provide in this repository both the means to reproduce these tests and the tests results itself. Lastly I also have the intention to add another tests.

 Notes:

- The DigitalOcean Wordpress app comes with ufw and fail2ban pre-installed. Also comes prepared to use Let's Encrypt SSL certificates. These are good security measures for less security versed people.
- It's a good security practice to not have installed builder tools and compilers in your server.
- Linode Debian Lynis audit had two warnings: an vulnerable old kernel image and iptables not configured. In CentOS the same warning with iptables.

 *Warning*: Security in a VPS is your responsibility, nobody else. But taking a look to the default security applied in the default instances of a provider could give you a reference of the care that they take in this matter. And maybe it could give you also a good reference of how they care about their own systems security.

 *Warning*: Lynis index should be take with caution, it's not an absolute value, only a reference. It not covers yet all the security measures of a machine and could be not well balanced to do a effective comparison.

 *Warning*: These numbers are provisional ones, I'm automating this process, so I going to repeat all of this tests for the already tested and extend them to the other VPS providers. I also have the intention of provide in this repository both the means to reproduce these tests and the tests results itself. Lastly I also have the intention to add another tests.
